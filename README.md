## Overview

This Android application is a demonstration project built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It showcases modern Android development practices, including:

*   **UI Design:** Declarative UI with Jetpack Compose.
*   **Data Handling:** Paging 3 library for efficient data loading and display.
*   **Networking:** Mock API for simulating network requests.
*   **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.
*   **Dependency Injection:** (Implied, but not explicitly shown in the provided code)
*   **Animations:** Shimmer loading animation.
*   **Search:** Fuzzy search functionality.
